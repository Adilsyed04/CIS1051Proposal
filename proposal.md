# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Text-Based Adventure Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be using python to make an adventure game that's text-based.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my text-based adventure game, I want to make it so players will have their own personalized journeys. Through yes or no prompts, players will be able to change the environment and progress through the story. Depending on their choices, they'll be able to become successful or fail. Throughout the story, they will encounter enemies, stumble upon treasure, and gain information from locals. The choices they can make are limited and will determine whether they are successful in their journey or not. From these choices, they'll either have an ending that is good or bad. What happens in the game depends on the player.   

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I believe I will create an adventure game that will have atleast an ending for the player to enjoy.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe I'll be able to create a finished game that will have one good or bad ending so players have to choose their choices carefully.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe the best out come would be a finished game that has multiple ending so players can have their own adventure.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project, I will look into other text-based adventure games to give me a better idea for mine. Then, I want to learn ways people make their game interesting and how they can create multiple endings. From there, I want to show my project to others so I can get feedback and know what I could do better. Some skills I would like to gain from this project is understanding python better and how to make projects.
